Welcome to FishPaste!

To start a new project with the CRED SPC data it first has to be made into a form that is analysis ready. To do this, there are a series of preprocessing steps (scripts) to clean up the data, select the desired fish summary metrics and pool the data into a workable form. We are using ProjectTemplate, the R package to automate the creation of new project that includes automatically doing this pre-processing. 
 
You first need to 'setwd()' into the directory (fish paste) where this README file is located. Then you need to run the following R code:

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

After you enter the second line of code, you'll see a series of automated
messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:

* Reading in the global configuration file contained in `config`.
* Loading any R packages you listed in he configuration file.
* Reading in any datasets stored in `data` or `cache`.
* Preprocessing your data using the files in the `munge` directory.

The first time you load the project, you'll want to make edits to the preprocessing files in the munge folder:

2_Fish_Base_select_summary_fish_metrics should be edited for whichever summary metrics required

03_Fish_Base_standardizing_and_pooling should be edited for whichever pooling level and scheme required.

Once these have been edited, then the data files are cached for quicker loading in future.

For every analysis, you can place the analysis scripts into the src directory. If the analysis scripts start with the two lines from above: 

	library('ProjectTemplate')
	load.project()

Then you'll have access to all of your data, already fully preprocessed, and
all of the libraries you want to use.
